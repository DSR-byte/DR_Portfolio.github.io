                <p>Built a small-scale wireless power transfer prototype utilizing LTSpice for circuit simulation, MATLAB for analysis, and Fusion 360 for mechanical design.<br>This project allowed me to apply newly introduced concepts in power transfer and regulation, bridging theoretical knowledge with practical experimentation at the component level.<br>I was able to successfully charge a battery wirelessly from a power supply, which made the results especially rewarding and exciting to demonstrate.</p>
