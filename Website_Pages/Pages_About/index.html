  Welcome! I'm glad you're here. This site has everything you need to know about me—from my background to my projects.<br><br><br>
  I designed and built this website myself to share my work, ideas, and passions in one place. Take a look around!

      Attending Cal Poly has equipped me with a unique set of skills that stand out in the industry.
      The university's "Learn by Doing" philosophy has allowed me to gain hands-on experience with tools such as oscilloscopes, function generators, and digital multimeters.
      I am proficient in industry-standard simulation tools like MATLAB, LTSpice, Fusion 360, Eagle, and more.
      <br><br>
      These lend to my comfort in the design and manufacturing process, enabling me to take ideas from concept to reality efficiently.
      I am also adept at troubleshooting and optimizing designs to ensure they meet both functional and aesthetic requirements.
      I have developed strong problem-solving abilities, teamwork skills, and a commitment to continuous learning, which I bring to every project I undertake.
      </div>
      <div id="content2" class="tab-content">
        I have over 6 months of industry experience in the world of startups and over two years of experience with common lab equipment. 
        I also have 5 months of experience with high-power equipment such as high-power induction motors and 3-phase power electronics like 3-phase inductors, etc.
        <br><br>
        Additionally, I have worked on projects that required designing and testing power systems, troubleshooting complex circuits, and collaborating with cross-functional teams to meet project deadlines. 
        My hands-on experience has given me a strong foundation in electrical engineering principles and practical applications.
      </div>
      <div id="content3" class="tab-content">
        My philosophy aligns closely with the definition of engineering as "the application of science and math to solve real-world problems within constraints." 
        I take on challenges directly and focus on delivering practical, effective solutions.
        <br><br>
        In team environments, I aim to both listen actively and contribute insight with clarity and purpose.
        I believe in collaboration models like shared leadership—where expertise guides decisions, not hierarchy—and constructive conflict, where differing views drive better outcomes, not friction. Above all, I work to maintain alignment on goals while challenging assumptions.
        As I see it, “The only constant in comparing success is knowing that you gave it your all.” That’s the standard I hold myself to—regardless of the outcome.
